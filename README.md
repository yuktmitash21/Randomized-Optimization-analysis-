# Randomized-Optimization-analysis-
All code is written with the help of the ABAGAIL library. 
To recreate my experiments, install Java 8 and Ant, clone the project here: 
https://github.com/yuktmitash21/Randomized-Optimixation-code-, use the command line to navigate to src/opt/test/admissionsTesting 
(this is where I have added all my code) and run the files. 
Most of the testing files will result in the creation of a .csv file, which can be used to graph the data.

As a side note, I used some code from this repository to recreate some of the experiments: https://github.com/willzma/ABAGAIL.
